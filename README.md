# Bandit Wargame Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and walkthroughs for the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame. Bandit is a beginner-friendly CTF-style wargame that teaches Linux command line skills and basic security concepts.

## 📁 Contents

- **Level 0-10**: Basic Linux commands and file operations
- **Level 11-20**: Encoding, cryptography, and network connections
- **Level 21+**: Cron jobs, scripting, and privilege escalation

## 🎯 Skills Practiced

- **Linux Command Line**: File navigation, permissions, text processing
- **Cryptography**: Base64, ROT13, hex decoding, file signatures
- **Networking**: SSH, netcat, SSL connections
- **Scripting**: Bash automation, cron jobs
- **Privilege Escalation**: SUID binaries, password cracking

## 🚀 Level Highlights

### Level 0-10
- Basic file operations and permissions
- SSH key authentication
- Finding files by size, content, and permissions

### Level 11-20  
- File encoding/decoding (base64, ROT13, hex)
- Network services and password submission
- Nested file extraction (gzip, bzip2, tar)

### Level 21+
- Cron job analysis and exploitation
- Environment variable manipulation
- SUID binary exploitation
- Inter-process communication

## 🔧 Tools Used
